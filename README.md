## 📌 Overview
**Underwater-Image-Super-Resolution-using-GANs** is a comprehensive developer tool leveraging **GAN-based models** and **AI APIs** to enhance underwater images, improving clarity and detail for analysis or display.  
It combines **deep learning**, **web-based interaction**, and **quality evaluation** to streamline underwater image processing.

---

## 💡 Why This Project?
This project aims to deliver **high-quality underwater image enhancement** with reliability and ease of use.

### Core Features:
- 🧪 **AI-Driven Enhancement**: Utilizes an external AI API for superior image quality, with a fallback to **OpenCV-based contrast enhancement** to ensure robustness.  
- 🌐 **Interactive Web Interface**: Upload images, view results side-by-side, and compare quality metrics in real-time.  
- 📊 **Quantitative Metrics**: Calculates **PSNR**, **SSIM**, and **UIQM** to objectively evaluate improvements.  
- 🔧 **Seamless Integration**: Combines enhancement, metric computation, and frontend rendering for a smooth user experience.  
- 🚀 **Open-Source & Extensible**: Easy to set up with clear dependencies, supporting further customization and development.
